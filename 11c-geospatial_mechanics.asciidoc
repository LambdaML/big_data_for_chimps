| GeoCentroid  | 0 | 0 | 15 | 5 |
| GeoConvexHull  | 0 | 0 | 15 | 5 |
| GeoBoundary  | EMPTY | MULTIPOINT | 15 | 5 | A point's boundary is empty; a line's boundary is its composite points; a polygon's boundary is its rings; and a multi-geometry's boundary is the combined boundaries of its parts.

==== Other Spatial Operations

|===========================================================================
| GeoMultiToBag  | splits a multi-geometry into a bag of simple geometries: one MultiPoint geometriy becomes a bag of Points 
| GeoBagToMulti  | combines a bag o objects into a single multi-whatever: a bag of points and MultiPoints becomes a single MultiPoint object
