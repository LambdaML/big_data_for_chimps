== Hadoop Basics

=== Introduction

In this chapter, we will equip you with two things: the necessary mechanics of working with Hadoop, and a physical intuition for how data and computation move around the cluster during a job. 

Hadoop is a large and complex beast. It can be bewildering to even begin to use the system, and so in this chapter we're going to purposefully charge through the least you need to know to launch jobs and manage data. If you hit trouble, anything past that is well-covered in Hadoop's excellent and detailed documentation or online. But don't go looking for trouble! For every one of its many modes options and configurations that is essential, there are many more that are distracting or even dangerous. The most important optimizations you can make come from designing efficient workflows, and even more so from knowing when to spend highly valuable programmer time to reduce compute time.

The key to doing so is an intuitive, physical understanding of how data moves around a Hadoop cluster. Shipping data from one machine to another -- even from one location on disk to another -- is outrageously costly, and in the vast majority of cases dominates the cost of your job. We'll describe at a high level how Hadoop organizes data and assigns tasks across compute nodes so that as little data as possible is set in motion with both a physical analogy and by following an example job through its full lifecycle. More importantly, we'll show you how to read a job's Hadoop dashboard to understand how much it cost and why. You'll be using a docker simulation of a real Hadoop cluster on your machine. Your goal for this chapter is to take away a basic understanding of how Hadoop distributes tasks and data, and the ability to run a job and see what's going on with it. As you run more and more jobs through the remaining course of the book, it is the latter ability that will cement your intuition.

Let's kick things off by making friends with the good folks at Elephant and Chimpanzee, Inc. Their story should give you an essential physical understanding for the problems Hadoop addresses and how it solves them.

.Chimpanzee and Elephant Start a Business
******
A few years back, two friends -- JT, a gruff chimpanzee, and Nanette, a meticulous matriarch elephant -- decided to start a business. As you know, Chimpanzees love nothing more than sitting at keyboards processing and generating text. Elephants have a prodigious ability to store and recall information, and will carry huge amounts of cargo with great determination. This combination of skills impressed a local publishing company enough to earn their first contract, so Chimpanzee and Elephant, Incorporated (C&E for short) was born.

The publishing firmâ€™s project was to translate the works of Shakespeare into every language known to man, so JT and Nanette devised the following scheme. Their crew set up a large number of cubicles, each with one elephant-sized desk and several chimp-sized desks, and a command center where JT and Nanette can coordinate the action.

As with any high-scale system, each member of the team has a single responsibility to perform. The task of each chimpanzee is simply to read a set of passages and type out the corresponding text in a new language. JT, their foreman, efficiently assigns passages to chimpanzees, deals with absentee workers and sick days, and reports progress back to the customer. The task of each librarian elephant is to maintain a neat set of scrolls, holding either a passage to translate or some passage's translated result. Nanette serves as chief librarian. She keeps a card catalog listing, for every book, the location and essential characteristics of the various scrolls that maintain its contents. 

When workers clock in for the day, they check with JT, who hands off the day's translation manual and the name of a passage to translate. Throughout the day the chimps radio progress reports in to JT; if their assigned passage is complete, JT will specify the next passage to translate.

If you were to walk by a cubicle mid-workday, you would see a highly-efficient interplay between chimpanzee and elephant, ensuring the expert translators rarely had a wasted moment. As soon as JT radios back what passage to translate next, the elephant hands it across. The chimpanzee types up the translation on a new scroll, hands it back to its librarian partner and radios for the next passage. The librarian runs the scroll through a fax machine to send it to two of its counterparts at other cubicles, producing the redundant, triplicate copies Nanette's scheme requires. 

The librarians in turn notify Nanette which copies of which translations they hold, which helps Nanette maintain her card catalog. Whenever a customer comes calling for a translated passage, Nanette fetches all three copies and ensures they are consistent. This way, the work of each monkey can be compared to ensure its integrity, and documents can still be retrieved even if a cubicle radio fails.

The fact that each chimpanzee's work is independent of any other's -- no interoffice memos, no meetings, no requests for documents from other departments -- made this the perfect first contract for the C&E crew. JT and Nanette, however, were cooking up a new way to put their million-chimp army to work, one that could radically streamline the processes of any modern paperful office footnote:[Some chimpanzee philosophers have put forth the fanciful conceit of a "paper-less" office, requiring impossibilities like a sea of electrons that do the work of a chimpanzee, and disks of magnetized iron that would serve as scrolls. These ideas are, of course, pure lunacy!]. JT and Nanette would soon have the chance of a lifetime to try it out for a customer in the far north with a big, big problem.
******

=== Map-only Jobs: Process Records Individually ===

As you'd guess, the way Chimpanzee and Elephant organize their files and workflow corresponds directly with how Hadoop handles data and computation under the hood. We can now use it to walk you through an example in detail.

Nanette is the name node.

JT is the jobtracker.

We may not be as clever as JT's multilingual chimpanzees, but even we can translate text into a language we'll call _Igpay Atinlay_. footnote:[Sharp-eyed readers will note that this language is really called _Pig Latin._ That term has another name in the Hadoop universe, though, so we've chosen to call it Igpay Atinlay -- Pig Latin for "Pig Latin".]. For the unfamiliar, here's how to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin#Rules[translate standard English into Igpay Atinlay]:

* If the word begins with a consonant-sounding letter or letters, move them to the end of the word adding "ay": "happy" becomes "appy-hay", "chimp" becomes "imp-chay" and "yes" becomes "es-yay".
* In words that begin with a vowel, just append the syllable "way": "another" becomes "another-way", "elephant" becomes "elephant-way".

<<pig_latin_translator>>  is our first Hadoop job, a program that translates plain text files into Igpay Atinlay. This is a Hadoop job stripped to its barest minimum, one that does just enough to each record that you believe it happened but with no distractions. That makes it convenient to learn how to launch a job; how to follow its progress; and where Hadoop reports performance metrics such as run time and amount of data moved.  What's more, the very fact that it's trivial makes it one of the most important examples to run. For comparable input and output size, no regular Hadoop job can out-perform this one in practice, so it's a key reference point to carry in mind.

We've written this example in Wukong, a simple library to rapidly develop big data analyses. Like the chimpanzees, it is single-concern: there's nothing in there about loading files, parallelism, network sockets or anything else. Yet you can run it over a text file from the commandline -- or run it over petabytes on a cluster (should you for whatever reason have a petabyte of text crying out for pig-latinizing).

  end

end

* The first few lines define "regular expressions" selecting the initial characters (if any) to move. Writing their names in ALL CAPS makes them be constants.
* Wukong calls the `each_line do ... end` block with each line; the `|line|` part puts it in the `line` variable.
* the `gsub` ("globally substitute") statement calls its `do ... end` block with each matched word, and replaces that word with the last line of the block.
* `yield(latinized)` hands off the `latinized` string for wukong to output
****

It's best to begin developing jobs locally on a subset of data, because they are faster and cheaper to run. To run the Wukong script locally, enter this into your terminal's commandline footnote:[If you're not familiar with working from the commandline, Appendix (REF) will give you the bare essentials.]:

------
wu-local examples/text/pig_latin.rb data/magi.txt -
------

The `-` at the end tells wukong to send its results to standard out (STDOUT) rather than a file -- you can pipe its output into other unix commands or Wukong scripts. In this case, there is no consumer and so the output should appear on your terminal screen. The last line should read:

------
Everywhere-way ey-thay are-way isest-way. Ey-thay are-way e-thay agi-may.
------

That's what it looks like when a `cat` is feeding the program data. Let's run it on a real Hadoop cluster to see how it works when an elephant is in charge.

NOTE: There are even more reasons why it's best to begin developing jobs locally on a subset of data than just faster and cheaper. What's more, though, extracting a meaningful subset of tables also forces you to get to know your data and its relationships. And since all the data is local, you're forced into the good practice of first addressing "what would I like to do with this data" and only then considering "how shall I do so efficiently". Beginners often want to believe the opposite, but experience has taught us that it's nearly always worth the upfront investment to prepare a subset, and not to think about efficiency from the beginning.


=== Transferring data to the cluster

[NOTE]
.Are you running on a cluster?
======

If you've skimmed Hadoop's documentation already, you've probaby seen the terms _fully-distributed,_ _pseudo-distributed,_ and _local_ bandied about. Those describe different ways to setup your Hadoop cluster, and they're relevant to how you'll run the examples in this chapter.
If you follow our advice and only use Hadoop through its medium and high-level abstractions,
you can develop and test a job using your laptop 
during a long-haul flight with no network access, then run it on a cluster 

If you want to running the examples on the single machine you're sitting in front of, , you're likely running . That means all of the computation work takes place on your machine, and all of your data sits on your local filesystem.

// we recommend you

On the other hand, if you have access to a cluster, your jobs run in fully-distributed mode. All the work is farmed out to the cluster machines. In this case, your data will sit in the cluster's filesystem called HDFS.

Run the following commands to copy your data to HDFS:

------
hadoop fs -mkdir ./data
hadoop fs -put   wukong_example_data/text ./data/
------

These commands understand `./data/text` to be a path on the HDFS, not your local disk; the dot `.` is treated as your HDFS home directory (use it as you would `~` in Unix.). The `wu-put` command, which takes a list of local paths and copies them to the HDFS, treats its final argument as an HDFS path by default, and all the preceding paths as being local.

// If you want to test you
// You might also see references to 'pseudo-distributed mode'. Our advice is to avoid it.

(Note: if you don't have access to a Hadoop cluster, Appendix 1 (REF) lists resources for acquiring one.)
======

==== Run the Job ====

First, let's test on the same tiny little file we used at the commandline. This command does not process any data but instead instructs _Hadoop_ to process the data, and so its output will contain information on how the job is progressing.

// Make sure to notice how much _longer_ it takes this elephant to squash a flea than it took to run without Hadoop.

------
wukong launch examples/text/pig_latin.rb ./data/text/magi.txt ./output/latinized_magi.txt
------

// TODO-CODE: something about what the reader can expect to see on screen

While the script outputs a bunch of happy robot-ese to your screen, open up the jobtracker in your browser window (see the sidebar REF). The job should appear on the jobtracker window within a few seconds -- likely in more time than the whole job took to complete.

.The Jobtracker Console
********
When you are running on a distributed Hadoop cluster, the jobtracker offers a built-in console for monitoring and diagnosing jobs. You typically access it by pointing your web browser at 'http://hostname.of.jobtracker:50030' (replace "hostname.of.jobtracker" with, you know, the hostname of your jobtracker and if that jobtracker is running on your local machine, you can use http://hostname.of.jobtracker:50030`). At the top, the cluster summary shows how many jobs are running and how many worker slots exist. Clicking on the hyperlinked value under "nodes" will take you to a screen summarizing all the task trackers in the cluster. Keep an eye out for other such hyperlinked values within the jobtracker console -- they lead to screens describing those elements in details.

Further down the page, you will see sections for running, completed and failed jobs. The last part of each job's name is an index showing the order it was received and appears in the flurry of messages when you launched your job.

Clicking on the job name will take you to a page summarizing that job. We will walk through the page from the bottom up because that is how to best understand the job's progress. The very bottom of the page contains a fun pair of bar charts showing the progress of each Map and Reduce task, from zero to 100-percent complete. A healthy job with many tasks should look like the screenshots below (CODE: Screenshot). During the Map phase, you should see a rolling wave of bars:  completed tasks at 100 percent on the left, pending tasks at zero percent on the right and a wavefront of running tasks that smoothly advance from zero to 100 percent at a fairly uniform pace. During the Reduce phase, you should see the full set of bars advanced at nearly the same rate up the page. Each bar has three sections (we will learn later more about what they mean but it is enough for now to know how they should behave).

You should observe slow progress through the shuffle stage beginning part way through the Map phase of the job and steady progress at a slightly higher pace as soon as the Map phase concludes. Unless you are heavily burdening your Reducers, the graph should walk right through the Sort stage and begin making steady uniform progress through the final Reduce step. (CODE: Check that shuffle progress is displayed as non-0 during Map phase).

The job is not completely finished when the last Reducer hits 100 percent -- there remains a Commit phase with minor bookkeeping chores, and replication of the output data -- but the delay from end of Reduce to successful job completion should be small.

The main thing to watch for in the Reduce phase is rapid progress by most of your Reducers and painfully slow progress by a few of them -- the "skewed reducer" problem. Because of either a simple mistake on your part or a deep challenge resulting from the structure of your data, Hadoop has sent nearly all the records to those few machines. Those simple mistakes are described in Chapter (REF); defense against highly-skewed data is, in a sense, the motivation for most of the methods presented in the middle section of the book.

Do not put too much faith in the "percent complete" numbers for the job as a whole and even for its individual tasks. These really only show the fraction of data processed, which is an imperfect indicator of progress and harder to determine than you might think. Among other pecadillos, some compressed input formats report no progress mid-task; they linger at zero then go straight to 100 percent.

Above  the job progress bar graphs is a hot mess of a table showing all sorts of metrics about your job, such as how much data read and written at each phase. We will run down the important ones a bit later in the book (REF).

Above that section is a smaller table giving the count of pending, running, complete, killed and failed jobs. Most of the values in that table are hyperlinks that begin the annoyingly long trip required to see your logs. Clicking on the completed tasks number takes you to a screen listing all the tasks; clicking on a task ID takes you to a screen listing the machine or machines running it. Clicking on the attempt ID shows a page describing that machine's progress through the task; and all the way on the right side of the table on that page, you will find three sets of links reading "4KB," "8KB," "All."  (TECH: check details). Those links lead, at long last, to the log files for that job on that machine. The "All" link shows you the full contents but if your job is so screwed up that the log file will flood your browser, the "8KB" link shows the truncated tale.

Lastly, near the top of a page is a long URL that ends with "job.xml". Do not go there now, but keep it in mind for when you have run out of ideas as to why a job is failing: it is a monstrous but useful file listing every single configuration value set by your job. 
******

You can compare its output to the earlier by running

------
hadoop fs -cat ./output/latinized_magi/\*
------

That command, like the Unix â€˜catâ€™ command, dumps the contents of a file to standard out, so you can pipe it into any other command line utility. It produces the full contents of the file, which is what you would like for use within scripts but if your file is hundreds of MB large, as HDFS files typically are, dumping its entire contents to your terminal screen is ill appreciated. We typically, instead, use the Unix â€˜headâ€™ command to limit its output (in this case, to the first ten lines).

------
hadoop fs -cat ./output/latinized_magi/\* | head -n 10
------

Since you wouldn't want to read a whole 10GB file just to see whether the right number of closing braces come at the end, there is also a `hadoop fs -tail` command that dumps the last one kilobyte of a file to the terminal.

Here's what the head and tail of your output should contain:

------
CODE screenshot of hadoop fs -cat ./output/latinized_magi/\* | head -n 10
CODE screenshot of hadoop fs -tail ./output/latinized_magi/\*
------

==== See Progress and Results

Till now, we've run small jobs so you could focus on learning. Hadoop is built for big jobs, though, and it's important to understand how work flows through the system.

So let's run it on a corpus large enough to show off the power of distributed computing. Shakespeare's combined works are too small -- at (CODE find size) even the prolific bard's lifetime of work won't make Hadoop break a sweat. Luckily, we've had a good slice of humanity typing thoughts into wikipedia for several years, and the corpus containing every single wikipedia article is enough to warrant Hadoop's power (and tsoris footnote:[trouble and suffering]).

------
wukong launch examples/text/pig_latin.rb ./data/text/wikipedia/wp_articles ./output/latinized_wikipedia
------

// CODE screenshot of output, and fix up filenames

Visit the jobtracker console (see sidebar REF). The first thing you'll notice is how much slower this runs! That gives us a chance to demonstrate how to monitor its progress. (If your cluster is so burly the job finishes in under a minute or so, quit bragging and supply enough duplicate copies of the input to grant you time.) In the center of the Job Trackerâ€™s view of your job you will find a table that lists status of map and reduce tasks. The number of tasks pending (waiting to be run), running, complete, killed (terminated purposefully not by error) and failed (terminated due to failure).

The most important numbers to note are the number of running tasks (there should be some unless your job is finished or the cluster is congested) and the number of failed tasks (for a healthy job on a healthy cluster, there should never be any). Don't worry about killed tasks; for reasons we'll explain later on, it's OK if a few appear late in a job. We will describe what to do when there are failing attempts later in the section on debugging Hadoop jobs (REF), but in this case, there shouldn't be any. Clicking on the number of running Map tasks will take you to a window that lists all running attempts (and similarly for the other categories). On the completed tasks listing, note how long each attempt took; for the Amazon M3.xlarge machines we used, each attempt took about x seconds (CODE: correct time and machine size). There is a lot of information here, so we will pick this back up in chapter (REF), but the most important indicator is that your attempts complete in a uniform and reasonable length of time. There could be good justification for why task 00001 is still running after five minutes while all other attempts finished in ten seconds, but if that's not what you thought would happen you should dig deeper footnote:[A good justification is that task 00001's input file was compressed in a non-splittable format and is 40 times larger than the rest of the files. It's reasonable to understand how this unfortunate situation unfairly burdened a single mapper task. A bad justification is that task 00001 is trying to read from a failing-but-not-failed datanode, or has a corrupted record that is sending the XML parser into recursive hell. The good reasons you can always predict from the data itself; otherwise assume it's a bad reason].

You should get in the habit of sanity-checking the number of tasks and the input and output sizes at each job phase for the jobs you write.


Remember, what we're learning to do is 'coach' Hadoop into how to process our data.

In this case, the job should ultimately require x Map tasks, no Reduce tasks and on our x machine cluster, it completed in x minutes. For this input, there should be one Map task per HDFS block, x GB of input with the typical one-eighth GB block size, means there should be 8x Map tasks. Sanity checking the figure will help you flag cases where you ran on all the data rather than the one little slice you intended or vice versa; to cases where the data is organized inefficiently; or to deeper reasons that will require you to flip ahead to chapter (REF).

Annoyingly, the Job view does not directly display the Mapper input data, only the cumulative quantity of data per source, which is not always an exact match. Still, the figure for HDFS bytes read should closely match the size given by â€˜Hadoop fs -duâ€™ (CODE: add paths to command).

You can also estimate how large the output should be, using the "Gift of the Magi" sample we ran earlier (one of the benefits of first running in local mode). That job had an input size of x bytes and an output size of y bytes, for an expansion factor of z, and there is no reason to think the expansion factor on the whole Wikipedia corpus should be much different. In fact, dividing the HDFS bytes written by the HDFS bytes read line shows an expansion factor of q.

We cannot stress enough how important it is to validate that your scripts are doing what you think they are. The whole problem of Big Data is that it is impossible to see your data in its totality. You can spot-check your data, and you should, but without independent validations like these you're vulnerable to a whole class of common defects. This habit -- of validating your prediction of the jobâ€™s execution -- is not a crutch offered to the beginner, unsure of what will occur; it is a best practice, observed most diligently by the expert, and one every practitioner should adopt.

=== Performance Baseline

This first example is what some people call an "embarrassingly parallel" problem: every record can be processed on its own. As you'll see, that means it uses only the _Map_ phase of Map/Reduce.


.How a job is born, the thumbnail version
*********
Apart from one important detail, the mechanics of how a job is born should never become interesting to a Hadoop user. But since some people's brains won't really believe that the thing actually works unless we dispel some of the mystery, here's a brief synopsis.

When you run `wukong ...` or `pig ...` or otherwise launch a Hadoop job, your local program contacts the jobtracker to transfer information about the job and the Java `.jar` file each worker should execute. If the input comes from an HDFS, the jobtracker (TECH: ?job client?) consults its namenode for details about the input blocks, figures out a job ID and any other remaining configuration settings, and accepts the job. It replies to your job client with the job ID and other information, leading to the happy mess of log messages your program emits. (TECH: check the details on this) Your local program continues to run during the full course of the job so that you can see its progress, but is now irrelevant -- logging out or killing the local program has no impact on the job's success.

As you have gathered, each Hadoop worker runs a tasktracker daemon to coordinate the tasks run by that machine. Like JT's chimpanzees, those tasktrackers periodically report progress to the jobtracker, requesting new work whenever there is an idle slot. The jobtracker never makes outward contact with a task tracker -- this ensures work is only distributed to healthy machines at a rate they can handle. Just as JT strives to ensure that chimpanzees are only assigned passages held by their cubicle mates, the jobtracker schedules strives to assign each map attempt to a machine that holds its input blocks (known as "mapper-local" task). But if too many blocks of a file hotspot on a small number of datanodes, mapper slots with no remaining mapper-local blocks to handle still receive task attempts, and simply pull in their input data over the network.

The one important detail to learn in all this is that _task trackers do not run your job, they only launch it_. Your job executes in a completely independent child process with its own Java settings and library dependencies. In fact, if you are using Hadoop streaming programs like Wukong, your job runs in even yet its own process, spawned by the Java child process. We've seen people increase the tasktracker memory sizes thinking it will improve cluster performance -- the only impact of doing so is to increase the likelihood of out-of-memory errors.
