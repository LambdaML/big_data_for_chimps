But you don't always need an exact value -- you need actionable insight. There's a clever pattern for approximating the whole by combining carefully re-mixed summaries of the parts, and we'll apply it to

* Holistic vs algebraic aggregations
* Underflow and the "Law of Huge Numbers"
* Approximate holistic aggs: Median vs remedian; percentile; count distinct (hyperloglog)
* Count-min sketch for most frequent elements
* Approx histogram

- Counting
  - total burgers sold - total commits, repos, 
- counting a running and or smoothed average
- standard deviation
- sampling
  - uniform
  - top k
  - reservior
  - ?rolling topk/reservior sampling?
- algebraic vs holistic aggregate
- use countmin sketch to turn a holistic aggregate into an algebraic aggregate
- quantile or histogram
- numeric stability
