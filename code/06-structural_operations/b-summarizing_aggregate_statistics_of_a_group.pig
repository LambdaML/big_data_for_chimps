-- === Group and Aggregate
--
-- Some of the happiest moments you can have analyzing a massive data set come
-- when you are able to make it a slightly less-massive data set. Statistical
-- aggregations let you summarize the essential characteristics of a table.
--
-- ===== Aggregate Statistics of a Group
--
-- In the previous chapter, we used each player's seasonal counting stats --
-- hits, home runs, and so forth -- to estimate seasonal rate stats -- how well
-- they get on base (OPS), how well they clear the bases (SLG) and an overall
-- estimate of offensive performance (OBP). We can use a group-and-aggregate on
-- the seasonal stats to find each player's career stats.

  totG   = SUM(bat_seasons.G);   totPA  = SUM(bat_seasons.PA);  totAB  = SUM(bat_seasons.AB);
  totH   = SUM(bat_seasons.H);   totBB  = SUM(bat_seasons.BB);  totHBP = SUM(bat_seasons.HBP); totR   = SUM(bat_seasons.R);
  toth1B = SUM(bat_seasons.h1B); toth2B = SUM(bat_seasons.h2B); toth3B = SUM(bat_seasons.h3B); totHR  = SUM(bat_seasons.HR);
  OBP    = 1.0*(totH + totBB + totHBP) / totPA;

-- We've used some aggregate functions to create an output table with similar structure to the input table, but at a coarser-grained relational level: career rather than season. It's good manners to put the fields in a recognizable order as the original field as we have here.

-- ==== Completely Summarizing a Field
-- 

-- The following functions are built in to Pig:
--
-- * Count of all values: `COUNT_STAR(bag)`
-- * Count of non-Null values: `COUNT(bag)`
-- * Cardinality (i.e. the count of distinct values): combine the `DISTINCT` operation and the `COUNT_STAR` function as demonstrated below.
-- * Minimum / Maximum non-Null value: `MIN(bag)` / `MAX(bag)`
-- * Sum of non-Null values: `SUM(bag)`
-- * Average of non-Null values: `AVG(bag)`
--
-- There are a few additional summary functions that aren't native features of
-- Pig, but are offered by Linkedin's might-as-well-be-native DataFu
-- package. footnote:[If you've forgotten/never quite learned what those
-- functions mean, hang on for just a bit and we'll demonstrate them in
-- context. If that still doesn't do it, set a copy of
-- http://www.amazon.com/dp/039334777X[Naked Statistics] or
-- http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Statistics-Dawn-Griffiths/dp/0596527586[Head
-- First Statistics] next to this book. Both do a good job of efficiently
-- imparting what these functions mean and how to use them without assuming
-- prior expertise or interest in mathematics. This is important material
-- though. Every painter of landscapes must know how to convey the essence of a
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLO7tCdBVrA[happy little tree] using a few
-- deft strokes and not the prickly minutae of its 500 branches; the above
-- functions are your brushes footnote:[Artist/Educator Bob Ross: "Anyone can
-- paint, all you need is a dream in your heart and a little bit of practice" --
-- hopefully you're feeling the same way about Big Data analysis.].
--
-- * Variance of non-Null values: `VAR(bag)`, using the `datafu.pig.stats.VAR` UDF
-- * Standard Deviation of non-Null values: `SQRT(VAR(bag))`
-- * Quantiles: `Quantile(bag)` or `StreamingQuantile(bag)`
-- * Median (50th Percentile Value) of a Bag: `Median(bag)` or `StreamingMedian(bag)`
--
-- The previous chapter (REF) has details on how to use UDFs, and so we're going
-- to leave the details of that to the sample code. You'll also notice we list
-- two functions for quantile and for median.  Finding the exact median or other
-- quantiles (as the Median/Quantile UDFs do) is costly at large scale, and so a
-- good approximate algorithm (StreamingMedian/StreamingQuantile) is well
-- appreciated. Since the point of this stanza is to characterize the values for
-- our own sense-making, the approximate algorithms are appropriate. We'll have
-- much more to say about why finding quantiles is costly, why finding averages
-- isn't, and what to do about it in the Statistics chapter (REF).
