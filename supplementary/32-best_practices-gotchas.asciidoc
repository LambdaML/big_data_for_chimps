=== Gotchas ===


* Hadoop commandline tools use the trash to delete items; programs using the hadoop API do not. <remark>verify Pig uses the trash</remark>

* The tasktracker heap size does not impact the amount of memory available for your tasks. You must adjust `mapred.map.child.java.opts` or `mapred.reduce.child.java.opts`.

* Stripe your data across all disks
  - Don't use the root drive
  - Don't RAID your disks


* Don't hit external services -- see <<server_logs_ddos>>.

== Tips ==

* Remove files from the trash immediately with `hadoop fs -rm -skipTrash /users/(you)/.Trash`

* **Input format for Zip files**: http://cotdp.com/2012/07/hadoop-processing-zip-files-in-mapreduce/[ZIP file input format]

* **Calculate file checksums**: https://github.com/jpatanooga/IvoryMonkey[IvoryMonkey by Josh Patterson] (@jpatanooga) will calculate a checksum _locally_ that you can compare with the hadoop filesystem's internal checksum. I'm not aware of a way to calculate the md5 or SHA1 checksum of a file on the HDFS short of doing a map-side job with a non-splitable input format (TODO update command for wukong 3.0 format)
