<h2>Parallelized Operations</h2>

<h3>Operations That Eliminate Data</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Select a Subset of Records from a Table</p>

<ul>
<li>Using FILTER:</li>
<li>Using Map/Reduce:</li>
<li>As we go along:

<ul>
<li>Finding Records That Satisfy Multiple Conditions</li>
<li>Pattern Matching in Strings with Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Controlling Case Sensitivity in String Comparisons (<code>ff = FILTER fr BY EqualsIgnoreCase(franch_id, 'bOs'); DUMP ff;</code>)</li>
<li>Controlling Case Sensitivity in Regular Expressions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finding or Rejecting Null Values</li>
<li>Select Records Using a List of Values

<ul>
<li>very small inline list with the <code>CASE</code> statement &ndash; <code>CASE X WHEN val1 ... WHEN val2 ... ELSE .. END</code> and <code>CASE WHEN cond .. WHEN cond .. ELSE .. END</code>)</li>
<li>very small inline list with the <code>IN</code> statement &ndash; FILTER a BY i IN (1,22,333,4444,55555)</li>
<li>non-huge-ish with a HashMap (replicated) join &ndash; see next chapter</li>
<li>Bloom Filters, discussed in Statistics chapter, can be good for matching against a very large list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Projecting</p>

<ul>
<li>Project a Only Chosen Columns from a Table Using FOREACH (Map/Reduce is trivial, should we include it?)</li>
<li>Renaming Columns from a Table</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Limit</p>

<ul>
<li>Select a Fixed Number of Records With LIMIT (Map/Reduce is painful, should we include it?)</li>
<li>Select Rows using a Limit and Offset &ndash; explain why we don&rsquo;t do this</li>
<li>Move Top-K, minimum and maximum values, etc down to sorting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Sample</p>

<ul>
<li>Select a Random Fraction of Records with SAMPLE</li>
<li>you can&rsquo;t really do the seed-resetting thing you said well&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Transforming Records</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Transform Records Individually using <code>FOREACH</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Nested <code>FOREACH</code> Allows Intermediate Expressions</li>
<li>Transforming Strings with Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Sidebar: Working with NULL Values</li>
<li>As we go along:

<ul>
<li>Transforming Nulls into Real Values</li>
<li>Converting the Lettercase of a String</li>
<li>Converting a Number to its String Representation (and Back) (cast with (int))</li>
<li>Embedding Quotes and Special Characters Within String Literals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Applying a User-Defined Function</p>

<ul>
<li>namely, converting a JSON-encoded string value to the actual string: i.e. &ldquo;Here is a snowman on its own line:\n\u2603&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;Here is a snowman on its own line:
☃&rdquo;</li>
<li>TSV and CSV don&rsquo;t let you have any old character you want, but are so wonderfully simple. In cases where you have a blob of text that you don&rsquo;t always want to pay to decode it, we will sometimes use TSV but JSON-encode the value of internal strings. You can be confident that all special characters have been safely taken out of band, it&rsquo;s compact and ubiquitous to decode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Assigning a Unique Identifier to Each Record (use <code>-tagPath</code> when loading; may require most recent Pig)</p>

<ul>
<li>I guess admit to the <code>$1..</code> syntax here (to include the rest of the fields after the first). But don&rsquo;t adopt the disrespectful habit of using this to mean &ldquo;the rest of the fields that I&rsquo;m too lazy to type in&rdquo;; only use this for &ldquo;the rest of the fields, whatever they happen to be&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Call forward to RANK, and to Over, for sequentially numbering records</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Operations that Expand the number of Rows or Columns</h3>

<p>Mono amine oxidase inhibitors &ndash; now there&rsquo;s a patch, which makes a difference
Iensam - blocks maoi-a but not -b. Is also on Vivance (a stimulant), but that&rsquo;s ok because not all is blocked that&rsquo;s ok.</p>

<p>leach</p>

<p>Flattening a tuple gives you columns; Flattening a bag gives you rows</p>

<h3>Grouping Records</h3>

<ul>
<li>Group

<ul>
<li>not often used on its own, but forms the basis for most structural operation patterns.</li>
<li>Group Records by common Key or Keys

<ul>
<li>Each team a player played for in career &ndash; for single key field, first field (<code>group</code>) is that value; next is the original record, <em>not omitting the group key</em>.</li>
<li>each team a player played for by year — grouped on team, year. For multiple keys, first field is a tuple of keys, next is the original record, <em>not omitting the group keys</em></li>
<li>if you want to group by an expression, synthesize a new field and use that.</li>
<li>group players by team and decade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Applying Operations to Bags

<ul>
<li>you can use a nested FOREACH to apply a subset of Pig&rsquo;s operations to a bag: DISTINCT, ORDER, nested FOREACH, FILTER</li>
<li>demonstrate with distinct teams in career.</li>
<li>we&rsquo;ll demonstrate the others  as we go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>group       Creating a Delimited List Within a Field from Table Rows

<ul>
<li>one use is denormalizing multiple values into one field.</li>
<li>use the pig 0.12 CONCAT to string them together</li>
<li>in the flatten section we showed how to undo this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summarizing Groups with Aggregate Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Calculating Summary Statistics on Groups with Aggregate Functions</p>

<ul>
<li>COUNT_STAR(), Count Distinct, count of nulls, MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), AVG() and STDEV()

<ul>
<li>there are a core set of aggregate functions that we use to summarize the</li>
<li>Use COUNT_STAR() to count Records in a Group; MIN() and MAX() to find the single largest / smallest values in a group; SUM() to find the total of all values in a group. The built-in AVG() function returns the arithmetic mean. To find the standard deviation, use the (double check the name) function from Datafu.</li>
<li>describe difference between count and count_star. Note that the number of null values is (count_star - count). Recommend to always use COUNT_STAR unless you are explicitly conveying that you want to exclude nulls. Make sure we follow that advice.</li>
<li>demonstrate this for summarizing players' weight and height by year. Show a stock-market style candlestick graph of weight and of height (min, avg-STDEV, avg, avg+STDEV, max), with graph of &ldquo;volume&rdquo; (count, count distinct and count_star) below it. Players are getting bigger and stronger; more of them as league and roster size grows; more data (fewer nulls) after early days.</li>
<li>the median is hard and so we will wait until stats chapter.</li>
<li>other summary stats (kurtosis, other higher-moments), no built-in function</li>
<li>nested FOREACH (in the previous chapter we found obp, slg, ops from counting stats; now do it but for career.</li>
<li>Aggregating Nullable Columns (NULL values don&rsquo;t get counted in an average. To have them be counted, ternary NULL values into a zero)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Calculating Full-Table Summary Statistics</p>

<ul>
<li>repeat example snippets but using GROUP ALL. note that there&rsquo;s no I in TEAM and no BY in GROUP ALL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Testing for Existence of a Value Within a Group Using the Summing Trick</p>

<ul>
<li>players who have ever played for the Red Sox — make a synthetic field and use MAX on it. If there is year where there is a &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the is_redsox field, this is true, meeting he goal</li>
<li>players who have ever reached figure-of-merit thresholds in a season: 30 HR, 150 hits, 350 OBP, 500 SLG, 800 OPS (check values)</li>
<li>summing trick: win-loss record; HoF standards test: 1pt batting over .300, 1-10 pts for each 0.025 pts of SLG above .300; 1-10 pts for each 0.010 of OBP over 0.300; 1-5 pts for each 200 walks over 300; 1 pt for each 200 HR. (And about a dozen more)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Distribution of Values Using a Histogram</p>

<ul>
<li>Histogram:

<ul>
<li>Games</li>
<li>binned games</li>
<li>multiple fields, (?reinject global totals)</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<h3>cogroup</h3>

<ul>
<li>co-group multiple by labelling and using secondary sort</li>
<li>group, bunch first, flatten (using player info on seasons to get age)</li>
<li>m2m: players-parks</li>
<li>self: teammates (filter for id1 &lt; id2, rather than using distinct); manageable cross product explosion. Mention &ldquo;everyone who ever got the same number of HR in a season; the 0-hit crew will explode)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Join Matching Records Between Tables</h3>

<ul>
<li>Direct Join:

<ul>
<li>Direct Join: Extend Records with Uniquely Matching Records from Another Table</li>
<li>Direct join on foreign key &ndash; ages for each player season</li>
<li>join        Combining Related Records by Foreign Key (The solution is an example of a join, or more accurately an equi-join, which is a type of inner join. A join is an operation that combines rows from two tables into one. An equi-join is one in which the join condition is based on an equality condition (e.g., where one department number equals another). An inner join is the original type of join; each row returned contains data from each table.)</li>
<li>join        vertical partitioned (Wikipedia articles and metadata; just call this out as an example)</li>
<li>join    direct  (is qualified: join on team)</li>

<li>join    selfjn  Comparing a Table to Itself</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>group2      (questions involving all: all players who played against every team during years they played. Use count(distinct teams) might work except that teams might vary over years. For example, if you are asked to find people who eat all vegetables, you are essentially looking for people for whom there is no vegetable that they do not eat. This type of problem statement is typically categorized as relational division. With questions regarding “any,” it is crucial you pay close attention to how the question is phrased. Consider the difference between these two requirements: “a student who takes any class” and “a plane faster than any train.” The former implies, “find a student who takes at least one class,” while the latter implies “find a plane that is faster than all trains.”</li>
<li>group2      Answering Questions Involving Negation (player info for player who have not played for the yankees; cant do join(filter teamyear!=NYA). Need to do antijoin of(filter == nya) or use the summing trick! Generate is_inthere and then do max or sum. Quoting Rozenshtein’s book: &ldquo;To find out “who does not,” first find out “who does” and then get rid of them.&rdquo; (Is there an &ldquo;IN&rdquo;? And which is best?)

Group on player id is a group and flatten. Instead, group decorate flatten on full player stats is already subsumed into cost, and player id is too. The exception (and this is likely one) is if the join table is small enough to do a HashMap join; in that case it&rsquo;s a reduce of just the full OPS list, map-only HashMap join, final group. In next chapter, will be one where join totally loses.)</li>
