## Datasets

> Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PIN-1) compiled by Bu et al. [32] on data obtained by von Mering et al. [33] by assessing a total of 80,000 interactions among 5400 proteins assigning each interaction a confidence value. Bu et al. [32] focused on 11,855 interactions between 2617 proteins with high and medium confidence in order to reduce the influence of false positives. The PIN of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (PIN-2) obtained from the Database of Interacting Proteins [34]; (iii–iv) two vocabulary networks in which nodes represent words taken from a dictionary. A directed link from a word to another exists if the first word is used in the definition of the second one. One of these networks is built using the Roget’s Thesaurus of English (Roget) [35], and the other is built using the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science (ODLIS) [36]; (v) a scientific collaboration network in the field of computational geometry compiled from the Computational Geometry Database, version of February 2002 [37] where nodes represent scientists, and two nodes are connected if the corresponding authors wrote a paper together; (vi) a citation network of papers published in the Proceedings of Graph Drawing in the period 1994– 2000 [38] where nodes are papers and two nodes are connected if one paper cites another; (vii– viii) the Internet at the autonomous systems (AS) level as of September 1997 and of April 1998 analyzed by Faloutsos et al. [6]. Although some of these relationships are inherently directed, we have ignored direction and consider networks to be undirected for the current analysis. On the other hand, in order to make appropriate comparisons between SC and the other centrality measures, we studied only the main component of these networks owing to the fact that some of the centrality measures cannot be defined for nonconnected graphs. Datasets were collected from the European Project COSIN (http://www.cosin.org/) and from Pajek program datasets (http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/).

#### Newman & Girvan

> Shortest-path betweenness
> At first sight, it appears that calculating the edge be- tweenness measure based on geodesic paths for all edges will take O(mn2) operations on a graph with m edges and n vertices: calculating the shortest path between a particular pair of vertices can be done using breadth-first search in time O(m) [28, 29], and there are O(n2) ver- tex pairs. Recently however new algorithms have been proposed by Newman [30] and independently by Bran- des [31] that can perform the calculation faster than this, finding all betweennesses in O(mn) time. Both Newman and Brandes gave algorithms for the standard Freeman vertex betweenness, but it is trivial to adapt their algo- rithms for edge betweenness. We describe the resulting method here for the algorithm of Newman.
> Breadth-first search can find shortest paths from a sin- gle vertex s to all others in time O(m). In the simplest case, when there is only a single shortest path from the source vertex to any other (we will consider other cases in a moment) the resulting set of paths forms a shortest- path tree—see Fig. 4a. We can now use this tree to calcu- late the contribution to betweenness for each edge from this set of paths as follows. We find first the “leaves” of the tree, i.e., those nodes such that no shortest paths to other nodes pass through them, and we assign a score of 1 to the single edge that connects each to the rest of the tree, as shown in the figure. Then, starting with those edges that are farthest from the source vertex on the tree, i.e., lowest in Fig. 4a, we work upwards, assigning a score to each edge that is 1 plus the sum of the scores on the neighboring edges immediately below it. When we have gone though all edges in the tree, the resulting scores are the betweenness counts for the paths from vertex s. Repeating the process for all possible vertices s and sum- ming the scores, we arrive at the full betweenness scores for shortest paths between all pairs.

## Clustering

### random Walk Clustering

#### from 0906

> Random walks (Hughes, 1995) can also be useful to find communities. If a graph has a strong community structure, a random walker spends a long time inside a community due to the high density of internal edges and consequent number of paths that could be followed. Here we describe the most popular clustering algorithms based on random walks. All of them can be trivially extended to the case of weighted graphs.
> Zhou used random walks to define a distance between pairs of vertices (Zhou, 2003a): the distance dij between i and j is the average number of edges that a random walker has to cross to reach j starting from i. Close vertices are likely to belong to the same community. Zhou defines a “global attractor” of a vertex i to be a closest vertex to i (i. e. any vertex lying at the smallest distance from i), whereas the “local attractor” of i is its closest neighbour. Two types of communities are defined, according to local or global attractors: a vertex i has to be put in the same community of its attractor and of all other vertices for which i is an attractor. Communities must be minimal subgraphs, i. e. they cannot include smaller subgraphs which are communities according to the chosen criterion. Applications to real networks, like Zachary’s karate club (Zachary, 1977) and the college football network compiled by Girvan and Newman (Girvan and Newman, 2002) (Section XV.A), along with artificial graphs like the benchmark by Girvan and Newman (Girvan and Newman, 2002) (Sec- tion XV.A), show that the method can find meaningful partitions. The method can be refined, in that vertex i is associated to its attractor j only with a probability proportional to exp(−βdij), β being a sort of inverse temperature. The computation of the distance matrix requires solving n linear-algebra equations (as many as the vertices), which requires a time O(n3). On the other hand, an exact computation of the distance matrix is not necessary, as the attractors of a vertex can be identified by considering only a localized portion of the graph around the vertex; therefore the method can be applied to large graphs as well. In a successive paper (Zhou, 2003b), Zhou introduced a measure of dissimilarity between vertices based on the distance defined above. The measure resembles the definition of distance based on structural equivalence of Eq. 7, where the elements of the adjacency matrix are replaced by the corresponding distances. Graph partitions are obtained with a divisive procedure that, starting from the graph as a single community, performs successive splits based on the criterion that vertices in the same cluster must be less dissimilar than a running threshold,
> which is decreased during the process. The hierarchy of partitions derived by the method is representative of actual community structures for several real and artifi- cial graphs, including Zachary’s karate club (Zachary, 1977), the college football network (Girvan and Newman, 2002) and the benchmark by Girvan and Newman (Girvan and Newman, 2002) (Section XV.A). The time complexity of the procedure is again O(n3). The code of the algorithm can be downloaded from http://www.mpikg-golm.mpg.de/theory/people/zhou /networkcommunity.html.
> In another work (Zhou and Lipowsky, 2004), Zhou and Lipowsky adopted biased random walkers, where the bias is due to the fact that walkers move preferentially towards vertices sharing a large number of neighbours with the starting vertex. They defined a proximity index, which indicates how close a pair of vertices is to all other ver- tices. Communities are detected with a procedure called NetWalk, which is an agglomerative hierarchical cluster- ing method (Section IV.B), where the similarity between vertices is expressed by their proximity. The method has a time complexity O(n3): however, the proximity index of a pair of vertices can be computed with good approx- imation by considering just a small portion of the graph around the two vertices, with a considerable gain in time. The performance of the method is comparable with that of the algorithm of Girvan and Newman (Section V.A).
> A different distance measure between vertices based on random walks was introduced by Latapy and Pons (Lat- apy and Pons, 2005). The distance is calculated from the probabilities that the random walker moves from a vertex to another in a fixed number of steps. The number of steps has to be large enough to explore a significant portion of the graph, but not too long, as otherwise one would approach the stationary limit in which transition probabilities trivially depend on the vertex degrees. Vertices are then grouped into communities through an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique based on Ward’s method (Ward, 1963). Modularity (Section III.C.2) is used to select the best partition of the resulting dendrogram. The algo- rithm runs to completion in a time O(n2d) on a sparse graph, where d is the depth of the dendrogram. Since d is often small for real graphs [O(log n)], the expected complexity in practical computations is O(n2 log n). The software of the algorithm can be found at http://www-rp.lip6.fr/∼latapy/PP/walktrap.html.
